# Responsive-portfolio
Homework #2

## Goals
My goal for this assigment was to create a functional portfolio application that is consistent and is mobile responsive, using Bootstrap components.

### Methods for achieving goals

* How I made my portfolio application functional:
    * I created a functional, deployed link for my application by creating a repository on GitHub in which I pushed my code to. Using GitHub Pages, I was able to publish my repository- giving the application it's own web address: https://lpenenburgh.github.io/responsive-portfolio/
    * Creating a nav-bar with functional links by using Bootstraps nav components and then connecting my 3 html pages together using "href=./...."
    * Creating working links to social media that open in a new tab using "target_blank"
    * Checked each pages' HTML using a validation service from https://validator.w3.org/ 

* How I made my portfolio consistent:
    * Using the same background image for all 3 pages
    * Using the same fonts and colors
    * Using semantic html so each page's code is similarily structured and easy to follow
    * Using a functional nav-bar that is identical on each page

* How I utilized Bootstrap compenents and grid system to make my application responsive:
    * Each page is layed out using Bootstrap's mobile-first flexbox grid. Each page and component in my application is positioned using their grid system by applying a series of rows and columns within a class of "container". 
    * To ensure my application is responsive to all screen sizes, each column includes how big the component will be starting at a xsmall breakpoint, then bigger. I also tried to use only Bootstrap components, since they are designed to be responsive and minimize the use of media queries- I didn't have to make any media queries of my own in my css because of this.
    * Utilized Bootstrap cards for both my index and portfolio pages and put my personalized information within them.
    * Utilized Bootstraps nav-bar component on each page to easily navigate between the three.
    * Utilized Bootstraps form component on my contact page
